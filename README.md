# NYT Opinion Digital Dev Assignment

- [completed code assignment](https://awal-dda.vercel.app)

## Deviations

- Fluid type scale compromises "pixel perfect" font-sizes at hard screen sizes from figma for consistent typographic hierarchy across all viewports.
- Logical properites compromises "pixel perfect" absolute positioning and sizing for consistent positioning and sizing across all viewports and writing-modes.

## Possible Improvements

- Text contrast accessibility. Should consider adding a text-shadow and/or killing mix-blend-mode.
- Image optimization: webps, srcsets, etc.
- Font optimization: woff2, subsetting etc.
- Scaling the logic for a production level project: re-assigning values to stores in respective components using a Map or Array that indexes all final image objects.

### Assignment

We appreciate your willingness to give better insight into your process and problem-solving ability. This exercise is broken up into two parts, each focused on separate but somewhat integrated skills: Design and Development. Apply editorial judgment using technology and design that shapes the journalism into a distinct and memorable experience. 

Please send us your responses within 5 days (You may also note where additional time would allow for specific executions, but aim to provide as much detail as necessary). See attached for the NYT typographic suite and feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.

#### Part 1: Editorial design

Below are two published pieces that could benefit from design, both in ideation and execution. Choose one piece to re-imagine: How would you tell the story differently? What would make the piece more engaging through interaction and art direction? We’re interested in your creative storytelling ideas expressed through distinct visuals, layout, type hierarchy, language and experience. Note where and how to use multi-media assets (though you do not need to build functionality, describe and show how the design would support its purpose and functionality). Please share sketches in figma or appropriate means.

#### Part 2: Code

A big part of our work relies on collaborative ideation between design partners and developers. We execute tight wireframes in figma, with each developer interpreting these sketches into a working build—making suggestions on how to improve for a seamless and well-crafted experience on desktop and mobile. Please use [this figma](https://www.figma.com/design/pQvTW6dZcn46ATBpnzcIKi/Digital-Design-Assignment-(Kazi)-(Copy)?t=B1Xh98nJvS3SZdsR-1) to build out a working design with code. Send us a functioning website url and Github repository for review. This exercise is meant to assess your technical skills in cross browser development and close attention to design detail.
